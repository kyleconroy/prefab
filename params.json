{"name":"Stackgo","tagline":"the basic configuration manager","body":"### prefab - the basic configuration manager\r\nprefab is a configuration manager for single machines. It configures machines in a simple and idempotent way. It is a standalone binary and consumes JSON. It is not meant to be a replacement for a full-fledged solution like Chef, Puppet, Ansible or Salt. It's ideal for creating reproducible development VMs.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ wget https://stackmachine.com/pf.tgz\r\n$ untar pf.tgz\r\n$ echo '{\"file\":\"/etc/foobar\"}' >> foobar.json\r\n$ pf apply foobar.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### prefab with Vagrant\r\nprefab doesn't need a special provisioner, just invoke it using the shell provisioner like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ provisioner :shell, :inline => 'pf apply node.json'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Contribute\r\nprefab is somewhere between the proof of concept stage and the alpha stage. But we're finding it useful. It's 100% written in Go, which makes packaging and distribution easy.\r\n","google":"UA-40664354-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
